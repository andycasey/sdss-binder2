Jupyter notebooks can often have 'state issues' when cells are executed out of order. Marimo notebooks fix this by having an internal representation of which cells affect other cells. When a variable or code in one cell is updated, Marimo will automatically re-execute any affected cells. This makes the entire notebook 'live', allowing you to create applications and interactive analysis tools. \n\nMarimo notebooks are stored as pure Python code, so they are easier to edit and store than Jupyter notebooks. \n\nYou can load Marimo notebooks through this BinderHub instance by navigating to Marimo from the Launcher page.","metadata":{}}]}
